Use ./generate.sh to generate the config option/variable tables.

Input files:
- mysqld.xml
    Maintained by docs team, contains full list of options and variables (status and system), with
    info about versions supported, possible values and help.
    Unfortunately it has a big problem, which is that some system variables may or may not
    be settable from my.cnf and there's no way to tell that from mysqld.xml
    We keep a list of system vars that can be edited in my.cnf in the 1_*.py script
    
    NOTE: This file can be downloaded from https://mydocs.no.oracle.com/wb-files/

- status_groups.py
    Python file containing a list of all status variables and their categorization. You can edit
    the categorization by hand or hack option_category_editor.py to edit it using a GUI
 
- variable_groups.py
    Same as above, but for system variables and also for config options from my.cnf


Output files:
- raw_opts.py and raw_vars.py
    Intermediate files generated by the 1_mysqld2optlist.py
    Used by the other scripts to do their stuff

- opts.py
    Config file option category/info data, used by WB.
    Filename is terrible

- wb_admin_variable_list.py
    System/Status variable category/info data, used by WB


Option Category Editor GUI:

To recategorize options (variable_groups and status_groups.py contain the list of categories that
each option belong to), you can use the GUI in option_category_editor.py 
You may have to customize it for your use, but the general usage is:
- Open the scripting shell in WB and load option_category_editor.py
- Execute it
- Set the directory to <workench>/plugins/wb.admin/backend/config/gen-opt
- Work on the editor and save the settings
- Run ./generate.sh to regenerate destination files
- Copy opts.py and wb_admin_variable_list.py to <workench>/plugins/wb.admin/backend
