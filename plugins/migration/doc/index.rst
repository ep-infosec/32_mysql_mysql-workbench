Welcome to MySQL Workbench Migration Tool's documentation!
==========================================================

The Migration Tool provided with MySQL Workbench since version 5.2.41 uses the *MySQL Workbench Migration API* to
assist you to migrate your databases from other RDBMSes into MySQL. Here we proceed to explain how to work with
the Migration API so you can code your own migration scripts.
